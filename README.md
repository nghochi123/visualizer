# Algorithm Visualisation

Visualisation tool to visualise simple algorithms.

## Motivation

Was wondering if I could make a visualisation tool similar to that of [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en) to visualise a couple of the algorithms that I learnt.

## Features

* Algorithms currently included:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Quicksort
* Description of algorithm
* Dark/Light mode toggle
* Color coded bars

## Usage

Just select the algorithm, the number of items (bars) to display, the delay time per comparison/swap, randomize the list and hit sort.

## Known issues

* Algorithms get slower over time despite not changing the delay time.
* Numbers do not disappear the first time the number of items are swapped to either 20 or 40.

## Tech/Frameworks used

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Future additions

Looking to add more algorithms/data structures such as linked lists/graph stuff.

## Color Palette

[Color palette](https://coolors.co/ef476f-ffd166-06d6a0-118ab2-073b4c) used for the sorting bars.
